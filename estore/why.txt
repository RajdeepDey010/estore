[25.04.24]Process to build the side-nav accordion:
    - lets integrate bootstrap support of javascript in our file to enable usage of bootstrap toggle or collapse features.So import the cdn link for javascript from bootstrap.com
    - first the button that we used onclicking of which the collapse feature needs to happen will have the "data-bs-toggle=collapse" and it will make it toggle-able.
    - second on this button only we have to assign id(accordion-heading-one) of the div that needs to be collapsed to "data-bs-target".
    - third we give the id(accordion-heading-one) to the div which needs to be collapsed.

Process to include the cat-nav transitions into mixin to make it global accessible to apply on accordion:
    - Make a mixin named underline-tranisition($width) in _mixins.scss. Here $width is to specify the parameter we want to apply to the transform scaleX().
    - Use it in the _cat-nav.scss by including it.Use the syntax "@include" followed by the mixin name "underline-tranisition(1.1)".Here 1.1 is the value of the transition line which is passed to the transform attribute.
    - Now similarly include it to the accordion.Inside a{} apply using @include underline-tranisition(0.4).

Process to build the Product Cards/Products component:
    - create a _products.scss & index.js files in Products component folder.
